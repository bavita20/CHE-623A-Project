Project on calculating phase equilibria for binary mixtures.
As this is low-pressure phase equilibria, we may chose to
use the φ−γ approach, which requires choices for the liquid and vapor phases. If I choose to
do the calculations with an equation of state, using Peng-Robinson, Soave
Redlich-Kwong and van der Waals, and standard mixing rules, mixing rules with binary parameter
and Wong-Sandler.
